    "A brief comment is due on assignments in Python. We should think of the command `a = 3` as binding the name `a` to the `int` object `3`. Names in Python live in namespaces, which can be thought of as maps from names to objects. The details of [namespaces and scopes](https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/classes.html#python-scopes-and-namespaces)  will become more clear as we increment our use of the language. At this point, specially when dealing with numerical types, it won't hurt to think of the object and its name interchangeably. However, you should always have in mind that a variable is just a name and nothing more. Ultimately names and the things they refer to are distinct entities, as is known since the days of [Juliet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_rose_by_any_other_name_would_smell_as_sweet). Note also that we have written the statement `print(product)` to print the result of the product to the screen. In the interactive mode, we might simply have typed `a*b` after assigning `a` and `b` since the results of operations are automatically printed. In the standard mode though, we have to use the `print` statement."

The (optional) command `return` causes the function to exit as soon as it is reached and passes the subsequent expression to whatever called the function. One important point to note is the colon `:` and the indentation. Everything we write inside the definition of the function and up to the `return` statement has to be indented. These indentation rules will be recurring whenever we change scope, which in Python is indicated by the colon. The concept of scope is intimately related with namespaces. It is yet another concept that is best learned by practice  and will surely become clearer as we advance. As to the actual number of spaces used for indentation, it is yours to choose. You must only stick to your choice (i.e., always use the same number of spaces) when changing scope through your code.  For readability we suggest indenting four spaces."

    "The last lines have introduced many concepts that we shall be using again and again. We will not go in detail at this point, but here goes a brief description of what is going on: both X and Y (capitalized! Python is case sensitive) are examples of iterables, which are data structures similar to lists. In other words, they have some internal structure. You can check their types as we have done before. Note in particular how the lists X and Y were created. This very practical method of creating lists is called [list comprehension](https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions). The subsequent lines use some of the functions provided by the `matplotlib.pyplot` module. Note that X and Y are both a discrete collection of numbers. You can look at their contents using the `print()` command. We chose their length to be 200 so that the resulting plot looked smooth, but you should always remember that there is no such thing as a real number! The plotted curve is actually polygonal. The code specifies that the plot should be red (\"r\") and also includes lines that provide labels to the x and y axes of our graph, as well as its title. The last line, `plt.show()`, is necessary to visualize our plot. In the interactive mode, it should generate a picture with the plot as output.  In the standard mode, a new window with the plot should pop up. You should try to put all these lines of code together in Spyder to see what happens. "
